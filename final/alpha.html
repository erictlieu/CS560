<h1>Interactive Data Visualization with Movie Reviews: Alpha Release</h1>
<h4>By Eric Lieu</h4>

<h5>Overview: </h5>
<p>This project will be an interactive data visualization dashboard using a dataset of movies and movie reviews.</p>
<p>There will be a node-link diagram with movies as nodes and user reviews of same movies as edges.</p>
<p>On the side would be a chord diagram displaying all genres and movies sharing those genres.</p>
<p>Below the chord diagram would be a rating histogram.</p>

<h5>Completed Features</h5>
<p>Partial completed node-link diagram</p>
<p>Histogram of ratings</p>

<h5>Upcoming Milestones</h5>
<p>Adding chord diagram of movie genres</p>
<p>More updates to node-link diagram. (Detailed tooltip, color by average rating.</p>
<p>By the Beta release, interactions between the visualizations.</p>

<h5>Roadblocks</h5>
<p>There is too much data for the node-link diagram to display properly with all movies and reviews. I selected the first 200 movies and also filtered by review amount as a possible fix.</p>

<h5>Project</h5>
