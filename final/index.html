<h1>Interactive Data Visualization with Movie Reviews</h1>
<h4>By Eric Lieu</h4>
<p>This project will be an interactive data visualization dashboard using a dataset of movies and movie reviews.</p>
<p>There will be a node-link diagram with movies as nodes and user reviews of same movies as edges.</p>
<p>On the side would be a chord diagram displaying all genres and movies sharing those genres.</p>
<p>Below the chord diagram would be a rating histogram.</p>
